GoingBeyondTutorial contains the prototype game developed by Scott Franz and Jeremiah O'Connor, under the guidance of Associate Professor David Galles, at the University of San Francisco. The project was done in conjunction with Kevin Carroll, a neuropsychologist at St. Mary's Medical Center. The purpose of the project is to develop a Kinect-based video game that could be used to aid the physical rehabilitation of patients recovering from strokes, paralysis, and various other physical/cognitive limitations. 

The game can be played with or without a Kinect for Windows system installed (simply use the left and right arrow keys to control movement). Kinect Calibration and control is still in development, but the game mechanics are in place: navigate your ship through an obstacle course of buildings, while trying to hit as many of the stationary targets (floating spheres) as possible. The game ends either when the player runs out of health from colliding with buildings, or when all targets on the course have been successfully hit. The game loops through the same course until one of those two outcomes is reached. Points accumulate based on the total distance traveled before winning/losing, as well as the number of targets hit.
